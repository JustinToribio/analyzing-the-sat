    "### Goal of this project  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to explore SAT results and NYC high school data to examine if the SAT is unfair to any particular groups of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine the Pearson correlation coefficients between the various columns of data in our dataset and SAT scores.  We will then explore the strongest correlated columns further by creating various data visualizations, such as scatter plots and plots of the data on maps of NYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of results  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data suggests that the socioeconomic status of the students' families has the most relevant impact on mean SAT scores."

    "The data file, `\"nyc_hs_data_clean.csv\"`, is located in the `\"data/processed\"` folder of this project.  It was produced by running the [cleaning-nyc-hs-data](https://github.com/JustinToribio/cleaning-nyc-hs-data) project, which can also be found in this GitHub repository.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 362 rows (1 for each school) and 79 columns in `data`.  It contains NYC SAT results by school for the graduating seniors of 2012 in the first few columns.  At the time of this writing, this was the most recent SAT data available.  The remaining columns contain graduation, AP (advanced placement), class size, demographic, school survey and location data for the same school year (or as close to it as possible if the 2012 data was not available).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will read the csv file into a dataframe named `data` and view the first 5 rows."

The maximum possible value is +1, indicating a perfect positive linear relationship (as one variable increases, the other variable *increases* in linear proportion).  The minimum possible value is –1, indicating a perfect negative linear relationship (as one variable increases, the other variable *decreases* in linear proportion).  A coefficient of 0 indicates no linear relationship between the two variables.  \n",
